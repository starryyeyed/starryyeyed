### Hi! I'm Alice :)

I'm currently an Undergraduate **Data Science** student at **UC San Diego**, with minors in **Design** + **Business Analytics**.

I'm passionate about innovating and designing solutions through tech, especially pertaining to *mental health*, making psychiatric care accessible to everyone. I have a few projects in the works such as an *AI model for CBT* + ADHD-friendly *productivity extensions/webapps* that I'm super excited to continue to work on throughout this year!

When I'm not programming, you can catch me playing video games, exploring coffee shops, journaling, or obsessively tracking every aspect of my life.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-park-seoyoung/) here. Looking forward to building more projects!
