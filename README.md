### Hi! I'm Alice :)

I'm currently an Undergraduate Data Science student at UC San Diego, with minors in Business Analytics + Design. 

I'm passionate about designing solutions through tech, especially pertaining to mental health, making psychiatric care accessible to everyone. I have a few projects in the works related to an AI model for CBT + ADHD-friendly productivity extensions/webapps that I'm super excited to continue to work on throughout this year.

When I'm not programming, you can find me playing video games, exploring coffee shops, or journaling. 

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/alice-park-seoyoung/) here. Looking forward to building more projects!
